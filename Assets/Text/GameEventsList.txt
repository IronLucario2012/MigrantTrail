I can only hope that Cassie is alright after the mess he's made of her childhood.\nHonestly, considering you mentioned things weren't getting better with the gangs in your area, you might consider leaving? I know it's come up before, but I heard that there was a group of migrants forming a caravan to try to come north and live in the USA, and I think they're probably passing by San Salvador sometime soon. We'd be more than happy to help you and Cassie out when you get here if you do come.\n\nThink about it?\n\nLove,\nYour Uncle Marco",
