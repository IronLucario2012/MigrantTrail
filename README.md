# Migrant Trail
My FYP, developed in Unity.

A game in the vein of Oregon Trail 2, with a focus on the migrant caravans in Central America and the struggles they go through.

TODO: Add more events, flesh out the world. Redo the time/distance system, building it the way I did was a mistake for this kind of game.
